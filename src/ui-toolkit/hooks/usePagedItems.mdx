# usePagedItems

Helps you manage which items should be showing based on the current page and number of items you want to show at once.

- First, pass in the full set of items
- Then, pass in how many items per page
- You'll get back an array
  - The first item is the subset of items to show
  - The second item is the paging object (to help manipulate the current page)
- As you manipulate the current page, the items to show will automatically update.

```javascript
import { usePaging } from "ui-toolkit";

let [itemsToShow, paging] = usePagedItems(items, 10);
```

It leverages the `usePaging` hook under the covers.

## Params

<PropsTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "allItems",
      type: `any[]`,
      description:
        "An array of all of your items. You will receive a subset of these items based on the current page.",
      isRequired: "Required",
    },
    {
      name: "pageSize",
      type: `number`,
      description: "The number of items to show at once (on a single page).",
      isRequired: "Required",
    },
    {
      name: "initialPage",
      type: `number`,
      description: "Defaults to 1.",
      isRequired: "Optional",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Returns

The hook returns an array/tuple.

```javascript
let [pagedItems, paging] = usePagedItems(allItems, 5);
```

- The first value is the subset of your items that should show based on the current page
- The second value is a paging object you can use to manipulate the current page
  - See the `usePaging` hook

### Paging object
