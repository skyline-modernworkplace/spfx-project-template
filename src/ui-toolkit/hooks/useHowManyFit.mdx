# useHowManyFit

A hook that keeps track of an elements width, and tells you how many children of a specified width would fit inside.
It also returns the width of the item so that each item is perfectly sized to fit.

This is what `Filmstrip` uses to figure out how many items in can fit based on the dynamic size of the parent element.

```typescript
import { useHowManyFit } from "ui-toolkit";

let parentRef = useRef(null);
let [numItemsThatFit, itemWidth, parentWidth] = useHowManyFit(250, parentRef));

return (
  <div ref={parentRef}>
    <StyledItems itemWidth={itemWidth}>
      {children}
    </StyledItems>
  </div>
);
```
