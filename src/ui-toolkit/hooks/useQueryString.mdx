# useQueryString

A hook that works just like `useState`, except that it persists the value to the Url as a query string param.
If the current url has a value for that param, that value will be used as the initial state.

> Check out this page's url. UI Toolkit uses `useQueryString` to keep track of the `active` documentation to show.

```javascript
// Import
import { useQueryString } from "ui-toolkit";

// Ex: Track a param called 'scope'. Default it to 'all'
let [scopeKey, setScopeKey] = useQueryString("scope", "all");

// Ex: Persist a search text to the url with a 'query' param,
// but wait a 1/2 second for the user to stop typing before updating the url
let [searchText, setSearchText] = useQueryString("query", "", 500);
```

## Params

<PropsTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "key",
      type: `string`,
      description: "The name of the query string param. This will show up in the url.",
      isRequired: "Required",
    },
    {
      name: "initialValue",
      type: `T`,
      description:
        "The intial value. Will only be used if there isn't anything in the query string already.",
      isRequired: "Required",
    },
    {
      name: "delay",
      type: `number`,
      description:
        "Defaults to 0. If you pass a value greater than `0`, the url update will be debounced. This is nice for situations like a textbox should update the url as the user types.",
      isRequired: "Optional",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Return value

Returns an Array (a tuple) with a getter and a setter, just like `React.useState`

```javascript
// You could call 'thing' whatever you want. Just like useState
let [thing, setThing] = useQueryString("thing", "");
```
