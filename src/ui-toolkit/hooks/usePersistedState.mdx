# usePersistedState

A hook that works just like `useState`, except that it persists the value to `localStorage`.
On load, if there is a value in localStorage, that value will be used as the initial state.
You can pass an optional 3rd parameter to specify `SessionStorage` should be used.

```javascript
// Import
import { useQueryString } from "ui-toolkit";

// Ex: Remember which tab is active across refreshes and browser tabs
let [tab, setTab] = usePersistedState("myapp-active-tab", "");
```

## Params

<PropsTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "key",
      type: `string`,
      description: "The name of of the cache key",
      isRequired: "Required",
    },
    {
      name: "defaultValue",
      type: `T`,
      description: "Will only be used if there isn't anything cache",
      isRequired: "Required",
    },
    {
      name: "storage",
      type: `LocalStorage | SessionStorage`,
      description: "Defaults to LocalStorage.",
      isRequired: "Optional",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Return value

Returns an Array (a tuple) with a getter and a setter, just like `React.useState`

```javascript
// You could call 'thing' whatever you want. Just like useState
let [tabKey, setTabKey] = usePersistedState("myapp-active-tab", "");
```
