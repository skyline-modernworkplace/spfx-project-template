# Welcome to UI Toolkit!

The PortalsDev UI Toolkit contains a suite of React Components, React Hooks, and core utility functions that are
reused across all of our projects.

## Developer Workflow

- `npm run start:offline` - starts a local/offline debugging session
- `npm run build` - will build the app
