# Card

The Card component is frequently used to display a list of items with imagery. Often it is shown in a grid.

```tsx
import { Card } from "ui-toolkit";
```

```tsx live=true
<Card style={{ width: "350px" }}>
  <Card.Image
    size={200}
    url="https://www.google.com/search?q=zebra+canyon+escalante+utah"
    src={images[0]}
  ></Card.Image>
  <Card.Title url="https://www.google.com/search?q=zebra+canyon+escalante+utah">
    Zebra Canyon - Utah
  </Card.Title>
  <Card.Tags
    tags={[{ label: "SlotCanyon" }, { label: "Utah", url: "#" }, { label: "WheresTheWater?" }]}
  />
  <Card.Description>
    This is the description of the Card. You can render whatever you want inside of a Card. But it
    comes with some sub components to handle common scenarios.
  </Card.Description>
  <Card.Footer>
    <Card.Info>Jan 2, 2018</Card.Info>
    <Card.Info>35 views</Card.Info>
  </Card.Footer>
</Card>
```

## Props

<PropsTable name="CardProps" />

## SubComponents

The `Card` component comes with some sub components. You don't have to use them. Most of them are just other UI Toolkit
components exposed on the Card object to make it easier to leverage them.

- `Card.Title` - styling helpers for the Title
- `Card.Foooter` - automatically alignes to the bottom.
- `Card.Image` - Shows with out Card padding.
- `Card.Description` - Has some built it spacing to make things look nice
- `Card.Tags` - Display a horizontal list of tags. Pass an array of `{ label, url? }`
- `Card.Grid` - Just exposes the `Grid` component.

## Basic Usage

YOu can put whatever you want in a `Card`. You don't have to use the `Card` sub components.

```tsx live=true
<Card>
  <h1>I am a card</h1>
  <p>And I am the description of a card</p>
</Card>
```

## Card Title & Description

Use the `Card.Title` component to render larger text. `Card.Title` is the same thing as uitoolkit's `Title`.
Use `Card.Description` to render paragraphs of text. It doesn't do much except give your p tag a little breathing room with padding.

```tsx live=true
<Card>
  <Card.Title>I am a card title</Card.Title>
  <Card.Description>I am a card description.</Card.Description>
</Card>
```

## Card with Image Overlay

Shows a card with an image, but that image has a custom overlay
Use the `Card.Title` component to render larger text. `Card.Title` is the same thing as uitoolkit's `Title`.
Use `Card.Description` to render paragraphs of text. It doesn't do much except give your p tag a little breathing room with padding.

```tsx live=true
<Card>
  <Card.Image src="https://s27363.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Zebra-Slot-Canyon.jpg.optimal.jpg">
    <BigDate date={new Date()} style={{ fontSize: "30px" }} />
  </Card.Image>
  <Card.Title>Card with Image Overlay</Card.Title>
  <Card.Description>I am a card with an image that has a custom overlay.</Card.Description>
</Card>
```
